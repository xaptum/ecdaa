A C implementation of elliptic-curve-based Direct Anonymous Attestation signatures.

Created to support the [Xaptum](https://www.xaptum.com) Edge Network
Fabric, an IoT Network Solution.

The project is self-contained, and provides all DAA functionality for Issuers, Members, and Verifiers.
Pseudonym linking ("basename signatures") is optional, and secret-key revocation lists can be used.

### Testing

```bash
cd build
ctest -V
```

Running the integration tests requires `-DBUILD_EXAMPLES=ON`.

#### Testing TPM support

By default, the tests use a device-file-based TCTI.
For this reason, `sudo` privileges may be required to run them.

The tests can instead be built to use a TCP-socket-based TCTI,
by using the CMake option `TEST_USE_TCP_TPM=ON`.

The TPM tests require a [TPM 2.0
simulator](https://sourceforge.net/projects/ibmswtpm2/) running
locally on TCP port 2321.

An ECDAA signing key must loaded in the TPM. The associated
public key (in x9.62 format) and TPM handle (as a hex integer) must be
in `build/test/tpm/pub_key.txt` and `build/test/tpm/handle.txt`.
Currently, only the `TPM_ECC_BN_P256` curve is supported in the tests.

Convenience scripts in the `.travis` directory can be used to download
and prepare a TPM2.0 simulator for the tests.
After building `ecdaa` in the directory `build` with `ECDAA_TPM_SUPPORT=ON`,
run the following steps:
``` bash
.travis/install-ibm-tpm2.sh ./ibm-tpm2-simulator
.travis/run-ibm-tpm2.sh ./ibm-tpm2-simulator/
.travis/prepare-tpm2.sh ./ibm-tpm2-simulator ./build/test/tpm
```

The `ecdaa` tests will now be able to create signatures using the TPM2.0 simulator.

### Installing

```bash
cd build
cmake --build . --target install
```

# Usage

The only header that has to be included is `ecdaa.h`.  The name of the
library is `libecdaa`.

The pairing-friendly curves supported by the library are set using the CMake
variable `ECDAA_CURVES`, a comma-separated list of curve names.
All curves supported by the `milagro-crypto-c` pairing-based-crypto library are supported.
If no `ECDAA_CURVES` is set, the default is to build `FP256BN`.

## Using a TPM

This implementation has been tested against the following TCG TPM2.0 specifications:
- Specification v1.38
- Specification v1.16 with Errata v1.5

Signatures can be created with the help of a Trusted Platform Module (TPM).

To do so, a signing key must first be created and loaded in the TPM.
This key must be created with the following properties
(consult a TPM TSS for explanation of how to create an asymmetric signing key):
- `sign` attribute must be set
- `restricted` attribute must NOT be set
- `userWithAuth` attribute must be set
  - The authorization must be a (possibly empty) password
- `scheme = TPM_ALG_ECDAA`
- `hashAlg = TPM_ALG_SHA256`
- `curveID = TPM_ECC_BN_P256`

Then, a connection to the TPM is established by, for example, connecting
to a TPM simulator listening locally on TCP port 2321.
This creates an `ecdaa_tpm_context` object as follows:
```
struct ecdaa_tpm_context tpm_context;
ecdaa_tpm_context_init_socket(&tpm_context, &public_key, key_handle, localhost, 2321, password, password_length);
```
where `public_key` and `key_handle` are the public key (as an elliptic curve point) and TPM handle of
the TPM signing key, and `password` is the TPM authorization associated with that key.

An ECDAA signature using this TPM-generated secret key is then created using:
```
struct ecdaa_signature_FP256BN signature;
ecdaa_signature_TPM_sign(&signature, msg, msg_length, &credential, &prng, &tpm_context);
```
where `credential` is an ECDAA credential obtained earlier and `prng` is an `ecdaa_prng`, both created as usual.

Notice that the signature thus created is not TPM-specific.
This means that verification of a TPM-generated signature proceeds as usual, using `ecdaa_signature_FP256BN_verify`.

## Cryptographically-secure random numbers

Many of the functions provided by this library (particularly, those used by an Issuer or a Member)
require a source of cryptographically-secure random numbers.

Such functions take a parameter of type `ecdaa_rand_func`,
which is a function pointer for a function that will fill a buffer with a given
number of random bytes.
The expectation is that this function will use the system's source of randomness
(e.g. `getrandom` on Linux, `getentropy` on OpenBSD, `arc4random` on Mac OS X,
`RtlGenRandom` on Windows, or reading from `/dev/urandom` when these others aren't available).
Note that a `ecdaa_rand_func` will never be called with a request large than 255 bytes
(so functions like `getrandom` and `getentropy` that have such a limit are OK to use).
Examples of such usage can be found in the implementation of the example programs,
in `examples/examples_rand.c`.

The easiest way to satisfy the requirements of the `ecdaa_rand_func` is to use
the libsodium function `randombytes_buf`, on systems supported by libsodium.

The security of this library depends critically on these random numbers.

## Naming Convention in API

All API functions exist in the `ecdaa` namespace,
and are focused on a small number of basic `structs` (e.g. `signature`).
Function names take the form `ecdaa_<struct-name>_<curve-name>_<action>`.
For example, for generating a credential when using the BN254 curve-type, the function
to use is `ecdaa_credential_BN254_generate`.

Output parameters are frequently used in the API functions, and come at the beginning
of the parameter list.

The fundamental structs have (de-)serialization functions,
and macros and functions giving their serialized length.
Again, the format of the serialized length macro/function is
`ecdaa_<struct-name>_<curve-name>_length` (capitalized for the macro).

## Example Programs

The `examples` directory contains example code for using the library,
where for simplicity communication between the Issuer, Member, and Verifier
is done using regular files.

The example programs use the FP256BN curve type.

NOTE: If using these example programs on a system where `/dev/urandom` is the only
option for cryptographically-secure random numbers
(cf. `/examples/ecdaa_examples_randomness.c`),
the proper seeding of `/dev/urandom`
(i.e. the amount of entropy available) is not checked!
Thus, in such situations, these programs are not safe to use in situations
where the system random number generator may not be seeded
(e.g. early in the boot process on some systems).
The example programs must be explicitly adapted for use in such situations.

### Creating a New DAA Group

When acting as the Issuer, run the `ecdaa_issuer_create_group` command
to define a new DAA Group.
This creates a new Issuer public/secret key pair
(the public/secret key pair is used for adding new members to the group
during the Join process, and the public key also contains the group public key).

```bash
ecdaa_issuer_create_group ipk.bin isk.bin
```

### Join Process

A Member starts the Join process to be granted membership in the DAA group.

The Join process begins with the Member requesting a nonce and issuer public key from the Issuer.
This process is outside the scope of this project.

Once the Member obtains a nonce and issuer public key from the Issuer, the Member
first extracts the group public key from the issuer public key.
If the extraction succeeds (indicating the Issuer is honest), the Member saves the
group public key.

```bash
ecdaa_extract_group_public_key ipk.bin gpk.bin
```

Next, the member passes the nonce to the `ecdaa_member_request_join` command to
generate its public/secret key-pair.

```bash
ecdaa_member_request_join nonce-text pk.bin sk.bin
```

The Member sends its public key to the Issuer,
who then passes it (along with its secret key and the nonce
it originally gave to this Member) to the
`ecdaa_issuer_respond_to_join_request` command.
This command checks the validity of the Member's
public key and generates a DAA credential and credential-signature,
which the Issuer sends back to the Member.

```bash
ecdaa_issuer_respond_to_join_request pk.bin isk.bin cred.bin cred_sig.bin nonce-text
```

The member passes the credential and credential-signature
(along with its public key, and the group group public key that it extracted earlier)
to the `ecdaa_member_process_join_response` command.
This command checks the validity of the Issuer's credential-signature.

```bash
ecdaa_member_process_join_response pk.bin gpk.bin cred.bin cred_sig.bin
```

If the credential-signature check succeeds, the Member saves the credential
along with its secret key (its public key is no longer needed).
The credential and the member's secret key will be used to create DAA signatures.

### Signing and Verifying

Any party wishing to verfiy DAA signatures for a DAA group
first obtains the issuer public key for this group, from the pertinent Issuer.
The verifier then extracts the group public key from this issuer public key,
as described in the previous section.
If the extraction succeeds (indicating the Issuer was honest),
the verifier saves the group public key for all later verifications.

Verifiers also maintain a secret key revocation list, which lists
DAA secret keys that are known to have been compromised.
The issuer may be involved in communicating this list to
all verifiers.
This process is outside the scope of this project.

A member creates a DAA signature over a message
using a basename (if pseudonym linking is required by the Verifier)
by passing its secret key and its credential,
along with the message to be signed and the basename,
to the `ecdaa_member_sign` command.
This command outputs a DAA signature, which the Member
sends (along with some indication of the DAA group
it is claiming) to a Verifier.

```bash
ecdaa_member_sign sk.bin cred.bin sig.bin message.bin basename.bin
```

The Verifier looks up the group public key (extracted earlier)
and the basename (if using pseudonym linking)
for the DAA group claimed by the Signer.
It passes this group public key and the secret key revocation list for this DAA group,
along with the message and signature,
to the `ecdaa_verify` command.
If the signature is valid, this command returns success.

```bash
ecdaa_verify message.bin sig.bin gpk.bin sk_revocation_list.bin num-sks-in-sk_revocation_list bsn_revocation_list.bin num_bsns-in-bsn_revocation_list basename.bin
```

# Algorithm

The signature algorithm is that of
[Camenisch et al., 2016](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-662-49387-8_10),
with two exceptions:
- The "fix by Xi et al." discussed in Section 5.2 is NOT used
when creating TPM-enabled signatures (the current TPM2.0 specification doesn't allow
such signatures to be created).
- During signing, a random nonce is included in the message hash, as discussed in
section 5.2.2 of [Camenisch et al., 2017](https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/639).

# Testing and Analysis

The unit-tests are contained in the `test` directory.
Test code coverage is measured using `gcov`, and monitored via `coveralls`.

## Valgrind

The Valgrind tool `memcheck` is used for heap memory checking.
Every build on `travis-ci` runs this test.

To run a `memcheck` test, do the following:

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo
cmake --build . -- -j2
# (benchmarks are excluded because they take too long under the Valgrind instrumentation)
ctest -VV -E benchmark -T memcheck
```

## Scan-build

Clang's `scan-build` tool is a general static analyzer, run every build on `travis-ci`.

The `scan-build` tool can be run locally by doing the following:

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
scan-build cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
scan-build --status-bugs cmake --build . -- -j2 #status-bugs means a bug causes a non-zero return code
```

Scan-build has a large number of options for specifying the types of bugs to look for,
so it would be a good idea to study those and tune our usage of this tool.

## cppcheck

The `cppcheck` static analyzer is also available, and is run every build on `travis-ci`.
To run it do the following:

```bash
cppcheck --enable=all -v --std=c99 --error-exitcode=6 include/ src/ test/
```

This tool is generally considered to have a lower false-positive rate than
many other static analyzers, though with that comes a potential loss of strictness.

## Address and Undefined Behavior Sanitizers

Google produced "sanitizer" tools (code instrumenters that check for errors
while running, and thus "dynamically") for checking memory use and
code that may produce undefined behavior.
These sanitizers are now part of both the Clang and GCC compilers.
The address sanitizer and undefined behavior sanitizer
(including the unsigned-int-overflow sanitizer) are run for every build on `travis-ci`.

To run tests using these sanitizers, do the following:

```bash
mkdir build
cmake . -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithSanitize
cmake --build . -- -j2
# (benchmarks are excluded because they take too long under the sanitizer instrumentation)
ctest -VV -E benchmark
```

## Coverity

Coverity static analysis is run after any push to the `coverity_scan` branch.
Coverity is a static analyzer provided by Synopsys, and the reports
for this project can be found by clicking the Coverity link at the top of this README.
